Fan-made SDK for Lethal Company using C# and MelonLoader.

# Description

## What is "MTK" or Modder's Tool Kit?
MTK is a fanmade MDA, or Mod Development API for the game Lethal Company. (and more games if I feel like it)

You can find the wiki [here](https://github.com/CMDR-3/ModdersToolKit/wiki)

If you want to make a mod for this game, you can use this.
Submit a pull request and I'll probably accept it (emphasis on probably)
I won't accept it if it adds utilities for cheating.

If you actually want to help - go ahead and help! I wont mind.
